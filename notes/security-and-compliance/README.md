## AWS Shared Responsibility Model

AWS responsibility - Security **of the Cloud**:

- Infrastructure (hardware, software, facilities and network)
- Managed Services like S3, DynamoDB, RDS

Customer Responsibility - Security **in the Cloud**:

- For EC2 instance, customer is responsible for management of the guest OS
  (including security patches and updates), firewall & network configuration, IAM
- Encrypting application data

Shared controls:

- Patch Management, Configuration Management, Awareness & Training

RDS examples of shared responsibility

- AWS responsibility:
  - Manage the underlying EC2 instance, disable SSH access
  - Automated DB patching
  - Automated OS patching
  - Audit the underlying instance and disks & guarantee it functions
- Your responsibility:
  - Check the ports / IP / security group inbound rules in DB‚Äôs SG
  - In-database user creation and permissions
  - Creating a database with or without public access
  - Ensure parameter groups or DB is configured to only allow SSL connections
  - Database encryption setting

S3 examples of shared responsibility

- AWS responsibility:
  - Guarantee you get unlimited storage
  - Guarantee you get encryption
  - Ensure separation of the data between different customers
  - Ensure AWS employees can‚Äôt access your data
- Your responsibility:

  - Bucket configuration
  - Bucket policy / public setting
  - IAM user and roles
  - Enabling encryption

  ## AWS against DDoS Attack

  In a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, an attacker uses multiple sources‚Äîsuch as distributed groups of malware infected computers, routers, IoT devices, and other endpoints‚Äîto orchestrate an attack against a target. This is a example of how we can get protected into AWS using firewall and other security services.

  <p align="center" width="100%"><img src="assets/ddos.jpg" alt="ddos" width="500"/></p>

- AWS Shield Standard: protects against DDOS attack for your website and applications, for all customers at no additional costs
- AWS Shield Advanced: 24/7 premium DDoS protection
- AWS WAF: Filter specific requests based on rules
- CloudFront and Route 53:
  - Availability protection using global edge network
  - Combined with AWS Shield, provides attack mitigation at the edge

## AWS Shield

AWS Shield Standard:

- It is a free service available for every AWS Customer and it provides a protection from common attacks such as SYN/UDP floods, reflection attacks and other layer 3 and 4 attacks (tcp/ip). It can be deployed on HTTP friendly services (ALB, API Gateway, CloudFront)

AWS Shield Advanced:

- It is a option DDoS mitigation ($3000 month/organization) and it protects against the most sophisticated attacks on EC2, ELB, CloudFront, Global Accelerator and Route53. It is a high level defense.
- 24/7 access to AWS DDoS response team (DRP)
- Protect against higher fees during spikes of DDoS

## AWS Web Application Firewall

WAF protects our web apps from common web exploit attacks (layer 7, http).

- Define a Web Access Control List (Web ACL):
  - Rules can include IP addresses, HTTP headers, HTTP body or strings
  - protection from common attacks (SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting)
  - Size constraints, geo-match (block a few countries)
  - Rate-based rules (count occurrence of events) - this one is against DDoS attacks

## Penetration Testing

AWS customers are welcome to carry out security assessments or penetration tests against their AWS infrastructure without prior approval for 8 services. For any other simulated events, contact aws-security-simulatedevent@amazon.com.

This kind of testing can be done for 8 services:

- Amazon EC2 instances, NAT Gateways, and Elastic Load Balancers
- Amazon RDS
- Amazon CloudFront
- Amazon Aurora
- Amazon API Gateways
- AWS Lambda and Lambda Edge functions
- Amazon Lightsail resources
- Amazon Elastic Beanstalk environments

And we have some Prohibited Activities such as:

- DNS zone walking via Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zones
- Denial of Service (DoS), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Simulated DoS, Simulated DDoS
- Port flooding
- Protocol flooding
- Request flooding (login request flooding, API request flooding)

## AWS Key Management Service

We have two types of encryptions:

- Encryption at Rest: data stored or archived on a device somewhere (On Hard Disk, S3, RDS, Deep Archive)

- Encryption in Transit (in motion): incoming data, while upload data, while the data are in the network. (Transfer from on-premises to AWS, EC2 to DynamoDB, etc)

<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="assets/encryption.jpg" alt="encryption" width="500"/></p>

Anytime we hear about encryption in AWS it is possible to be most likely KMS (Key Management Service). KMS manages the encryption keys for us.

**Encryption Opt-in**: we can enable encryption for the bellow services. it is optional.

- EBS volumes: encrypt volumes
- S3 buckets: Server-side encryption of objects
- Redshift database: encryption of data
- RDS database: encryption of data
- EFS drives: encryption of data

**Encryption automatically enabled**: theses services has encryption by default, due security requirements:

- CloudTrail logs
- S3 Glacier
- Storage Gateway

## AWS CloudHSM

CloudHSM is a dedicated hardware provisioned by AWS. Compared to KMS which provide a software who manages our keys, CloudHSM is a hardware provisioned by AWS where we manage our own keys.

HSM device is tamper resistant, FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliance. HSM = Hardware Security Module.

### Types of Customer Master Keys

**Customer Managed CMK:**

- Create, manage and used by the customer, can enable or disable
- Possibility of rotation policy (new key generated every year, old key preserved)
- Possibility to bring-your-own-key

**AWS managed CMK:**

- Created, managed and used on the customer‚Äôs behalf by AWS
- Used by AWS services (aws/s3, aws/ebs, aws/redshift)
- When AWS ask if you want to encrypt, it creates one of theses AWS managed CMK

**AWS owned CMK:**

- Collection of CMKs that an AWS service owns and manages to use in multiple accounts
- AWS can use those to protect resources in your account (but you can‚Äôt view the keys)

**CloudHSM Keys (custom keystore):**

- Keys generated from your own CloudHSM hardware device
- Cryptographic operations are performed within the CloudHSM cluster

## AWS Secrets Manager

It is an AWS service to store secret keys of any type. The secrets are encrypted using KMS.

- With AWS Secrets Manager we have the capability to rotate the secret keys every X days
- We can automate generation of secrets on rotation (uses Lambda)
- It has full integration with RDS (relational databases) and we can store secrets there (such as user and password of the database)

## AWS Artifact

It is not really a service. It is a way to download AWS compliance documentations. Is a Portal that provides customers with on-demand access to AWS compliance documentation and AWS agreements.

- Artifact Reports - Allows you to download AWS security and compliance documents from third-party auditors, like AWS ISO certifications, Payment Card Industry (PCI), and System and Organization Control (SOC) reports
- Artifact Agreements - Allows you to review, accept, and track the status of AWS agreements such as the Business Associate Addendum (BAA) or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for an individual account or in your organization
- Can be used to support internal audit or compliance
