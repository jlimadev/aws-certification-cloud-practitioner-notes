# ðŸŒŽ AWS Global Infrastructure

When we are talking about Global Infrastructure we can understand multiple geographic locations. On AWS This could be Regions and/or Edge Locations.

Benefits of Multiple Geographic Locations:

- Decreasing Latency: less latency between communications and packages transfers. (eg. From Brazil to Japan, it surely will have latency), deploy applications closer to the users (Edge Locations)
- Disaster Recovery (DR): Infrastructure is resilient to disasters, fail-over strategies (move to another region)
- Attack Protection: It is harder to attack a distributed infrastructure

AWS Infrastructure consists in:

- Regions: For deploying applications and infrastructure
- Availability Zones: Made of multiple data centers
- Edge Locations (Points of Presence): for content delivery as close as possible to users
