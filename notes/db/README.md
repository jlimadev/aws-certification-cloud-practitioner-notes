# ðŸŽ² Database and Analytics

Storing data on disk (EFS, EBS, S3, EC2 Instance Store) can have limits, so if we need to store data with some structure or definition, we may want to use database.
What is a database:

- Can structure the data
- Can build indexes to perform queries/search through the data
- Can define relationship between datasets.

Databases are optimized for a purpose and come with different features, shapes and constraints, thats why exists multiple types of databases:

- [Relational Databases](#relational-databases)
- [NoSQL Databases](#noSql-databases)
- [Databases and Shared Responsibility on AWS](#Databases-and-Shared-Responsibility-on-AWS)

---

## Relational Databases

- Use table to each Entity, the tables have attributes
- We can create a relationship between the tables by using keys (Primary Key/Foreign Key/Indexes)
- Looks like an excel spreadsheet, with link (relationship) between them.
- We can use the SQL (Structured Query Language) to perform queries

Basically we have two ways to create Relational Databases in AWS: RDS and Aurora. They are both managed by AWS, but Aurora is a cloud native and more cloud friendly while RDS will be running known technologies directly in a managed service.

- [RDS - Relational Database Service](#rds---relational-database-service)
- [Amazon Aurora](#amazon-aurora)

## NoSQL Databases

- NoSQL means non relational databases. They are built for a specific purpose and specific data models. They have flexible schemas for building modern applications.
- Types: Key-Value, Document, Graph, in-memory, search databases
- We can have the data in JSON (Javascript Object Notation) format (we can add new fields, nest data, support arrays, etc.)
- Benefits:
  - Flexibility: easy to evolve data model
  - Scalability: designed to scale-out by using distributed clusters
  - High-performance: optimized for a specific data model
  - Highly functional: types optimized for the data model

Example of JSON data

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "cars": ["Ford", "BMW", "Fiat"],
  "address": {
    "type": "house",
    "number": 23,
    "street": "Dream Road"
  }
}
```

## Databases and Shared Responsibility on AWS

AWS Manages the databases, it has multiple benefits:

- Quick Provisioning, High Availability, Vertical and Horizontal Scaling
- Automated Backup & Restore, Operations, Upgrades
- Operating System Patching is handled by AWS
- Monitoring, alerting

We can have our own database (and others technologies) in EC2 Instances, but we must handle and manage it (the resiliency, backup, patching, high availability, fault
tolerance, scaling)

## RDS - Relational Database Service

RDS Stands to Relational Database Service and it is a managed DB by AWS for databases that uses SQL as query language. We can create multiple relational databases types in the cloud, fully managed by AWS:

- Postgres
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)

Advantages of using RDS instead of using a EC2 deployed database:

RDS is a managed service:

- Automated provisioning, OS Patching
- Continuos backup options and restore to specific timestamp (Point in time to restore)
- Monitoring dashboards
- We can create scale to read data from replicas for improved read performance
- Setup Multi AZ setup (Disaster Recovery and Highly Available)
- Setup Maintenance windows for upgrades
- Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
- Storage in a EBS (Elastic Block Store GP2 or io1) inside an EC2 instance

**Important**: We cannot use SSH into our database instances.

Example of usage:

- Elastic Load Balance <-> EC2 Instances <-R/W-> RDS

  - The ELB will receive the web requests
  - The EC2 instances doing/hosting the application logic
  - RDS doing Reads and Writes

- RDS Deployment Options:
  - **RDS Read Replicas**: Here we can scale the workload of our DB, we can create up to 15 replicas. The data is written only to main DB and we can read the data from the replicas.
  - **RDS Multi-AZ**: Failover in case of AZ outage (high availability), data is read/written to main database. Can have only one other AZ as failover (the data will be replicated to failover db, that will be used only if the main db has any kind of issue)
  - **RDS Multi-Region** (read replicas): Disaster recovery strategy in case of Region issue, local performance for global reads (Example: so if we have the main db in us-east-1 and replica in sa-east-1, we can read locally from region sa-east-1 with less latency, but if we need to write, it goes to main db, in us-east-1) replications costs

## Amazon Aurora

It is an AWS proprietary technology (not open-source). Aurora is Cloud Optimized, so it have much more performance compared Relational Database Service (RDS).

- Amazon Aurora supports Postgres and MySQL
  - Compared to RDS running a MySQL database, Aurora MySQL has 5x more performance
  - Compared to RDS running a Postgres database, Aurora Postgres has 3x more performance
- Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB, up to 64 TB.
- Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more) â€“ but is more efficient
- Not included into Free Tier

---

## Amazon Elasticache

Is used to get a Redis or Memcached managed database.

- Caches are in-memory databases with high performance, low latency
- Cache databases Helps reduce load off databases for read intensive workloads, instead of use the repetitive query hitting the database, we can get common responses from our cache.
- AWS takes care of OS maintenance / patching, optimizations, setup, configuration, monitoring, failure recovery and backups.
- Architecture example:

```
Elastic Load Balance <-> EC2 Instances (possible ASG) <-R/W-> RDS
                                                      <-R/W-> Elasticache
```
