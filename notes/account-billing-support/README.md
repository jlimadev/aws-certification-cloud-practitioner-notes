## AWS Organizations

It is a global service that allows to manage multiple AWS Accounts. The main account is the Master account and the other are the child accounts.

- It has an API to automate the creation of child accounts.
- Since we can have multiple accounts, we can restrict actions within them with SCP (Service Control Policies)

Cost Benefits of AWS Organizations:

- Consolidate Billing across all accounts - which generates a single payment method
- Benefits of aggregated usage (use massive volumes of services generates discounts)
- Shared (pooling) EC2 Reserved Instances for optimal savings.
