## AWS Shared Responsibility Model

AWS responsibility - Security **of the Cloud**:

  (including security patches and updates), firewall & network configuration, IAM
- Encrypting application data

  ## AWS against DDoS Attack

  In a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, an attacker uses multiple sources‚Äîsuch as distributed groups of malware infected computers, routers, IoT devices, and other endpoints‚Äîto orchestrate an attack against a target. This is a example of how we can get protected into AWS using firewall and other security services.

- AWS Shield Standard: protects against DDOS attack for your website and applications, for all customers at no additional costs
- AWS Shield Advanced: 24/7 premium DDoS protection
- AWS WAF: Filter specific requests based on rules
- CloudFront and Route 53:
  - Availability protection using global edge network
  - Combined with AWS Shield, provides attack mitigation at the edge
