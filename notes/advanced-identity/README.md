## Active Directory Services

Microsoft Active Directory is found on any Windows Server with AD Domain Services and it is a Database of Objects. The main function of AD is to be a centralized service to manage users accounts, create users and assign permissions:

- With a central Domain Computer we have all the credentials stored, so any computer that belongs to that domain can have the user logged in.

AWS Also provides AD Services within AWS:

### AWS Managed AD

Create our own AD in AWS, manage user locally and support MFA authentication.

It works by establishing a "trust" connection with our on-premises server and they will trust each other in authentication.
