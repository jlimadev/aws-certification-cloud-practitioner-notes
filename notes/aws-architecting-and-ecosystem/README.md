# AWS Architecting & Ecosystem

AWS Well Architected Framework has general guiding principles to be applied:

- Stop guessing capacity of our needs
- Test our systems at scale
- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
- Allow for evolutionary architectures designing based on changing requirements (using IaaS)
- Drive architectures using data
- Improve through game days: Simulate applications for flash sale days

## AWS Cloud Best Practices – Design Principles

- Scalability: vertical & horizontal
- Disposable Resources: servers should be disposable & easily configured
- Automation: Serverless, Infrastructure as a Service, Auto Scaling…
- Loose Coupling: Monolith are applications that do more and more over time, become bigger. So we need to Break it down into smaller, loosely coupled components. So, a change or a failure in one component should not cascade to other components.
- Services, not Servers: Don’t use just EC2, use managed services, databases, serverless, etc.
