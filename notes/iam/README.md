Identity Access Management is a Global Service.

- First we have our Root Account. This account should not be shared or even used. We must use only to Create another users, called IAM Users.
- Users are people in our organization and they can be grouped.
- The Groups only contain users. (Not allowed Group Chain).
- Groups and Users are needed, because AWS Services needs Permissions, and we create these permissions for each group or user.

### IAM Permissions

**Policies**

- Users and Groups can be assigned to JSON Documents that contains the permissions (allowing or denying).
- Policies define the permissions to users/groups.
- Apply the "Least Privilege Principle". Only give the needed permissions.

**Roles**

- Are created for another Services, so they can access or execute a process inside another service.
- Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf. To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles.
- We need to create or attach policies to this Role to grant the permitions.
- CamelCaseNamed
- The most common roles: [EC2 Instance Roles, Lambda Function Roles, Roles for CloudFormation]

### IAM Account Security

AWS Provides more security abling us to add pretection mechanisms to our account.

**MFA (Multi Factor Authentication)**

- Password that you know + security device you own.
- Main benefit of MFA: if a password is stolen or hacked, the account is not compromised.
- MFA Devices: Virtual Devices (Authy, Google Authenticator), Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Security Key, Hardware Key Fob MFA Device, Hardware Key Fob MFA Device for AWS GovCloud (US)

**Password Policy**

- Set a minimum password length.
- Require specific characters in the password: Upper/Lower, numbers, non-alphanumeric.
- Allow IAM users to change theyr passwords.
- Require password change each X days.
- Prevent password reuse.

### How a user can access AWS?

A user can access AWS by:

**AWS Management Console**

- Root or IAM user + password (+ MFA optional)

**AWS CLI**

- Command Line Interface, protected by Access Key and Secrets. If wants to use the CLI in the own computer, so the user needs to install the AWS CLI.

**AWS CloudShell (CLI)**

- is a CLI inside the AWS Console, the user don't need to install this one.

**AWS SDK**

- Software Development Kit, for coding, also protected by Access Key and Secrets.

The access keys and secrets are genereated through the AWS Console and must be kept in secret. The users manages their own keys.
Access Keys is simmilar to the username.
Secret Keys is simmilar to the password.
