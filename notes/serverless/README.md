# Serverless

Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers donâ€™t have to manage servers anymore, it is just deploy and not need to worry about where it is.

Initially, serverless was pioneered by AWS with AWS Lambda, but now Serverless is the concept of fully managed services.

**Important**: Serverless does not mean that there are no servers! They exists but you don't have to worry about anything about them (no manage, provision or even see where are they)

## AWS Serverless Services

AWS have multiple serverless services such as:

- S3
- DynamoDB
- Amazon Aurora
- Amazon Athena
- Fargate
- AWS Lambdas
