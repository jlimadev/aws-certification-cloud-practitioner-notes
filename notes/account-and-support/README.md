## AWS Organizations

It is a global service that allows to manage multiple AWS Accounts. The main account is the Master account and the other are the child accounts.

- It has an API to automate the creation of child accounts.
- Since we can have multiple accounts, we can restrict actions within them with SCP (Service Control Policies)

Cost Benefits of AWS Organizations:

- Consolidate Billing across all accounts - which generates a single payment method
- Benefits of aggregated usage (use massive volumes of services generates discounts)
- Shared (pooling) EC2 Reserved Instances for optimal savings.

> AWS Organizations helps you to centrally manage billing; control access, compliance, and security; and share resources across your AWS accounts. Using AWS Organizations, you can automate account creation, create groups of accounts to reflect your business needs, and apply policies for these groups for governance. You can also simplify billing by setting up a single payment method for all of your AWS accounts. AWS Organizations is available to all AWS customers at no additional charge.

## Multi Account Strategies

We have various modes to create accounts in AWS:

- per Department
- per Environment (DEVL, QUAL, PROD)
- based on regulatory restrictions (using Service Control Policy)
- for better isolation (using different VPC per account)
- to have separate per account service limits
- account for loggings
- use Organization Units (OU)

<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="assets/organizational-units.jpg" alt="organizational-units" width="500"/></p>

Besides this strategies, we can also monitor all accounts by:

- using tags standards to billing purposes
- enable CloudTrail in all accounts to monitor all API Calls and send it to central S3 account
- enable cloudwatch logs to central account logging

## Service Control Policy

Service Control Policy (SCP) allows us to create Whitelist or Blacklist to IAM actions. We can apply it on Organization Unit (OU) or Account Level.

- **Does not apply to the root account**
- SCP is applied to all users and roles of the account (even the root user of the account)
  - Example: a rule saying that X account cannot create EC2 instances. Not even the root user of the account can create it.
- Must have EXPLICIT allow to any service, by default nothing is allowed.
- Deny in a higher level has precedence

The use cases for Service Control Policy (SPC):

- Restrict access to specific services
- Enforce PCI compliance by explicitly disabling services

Example of Service Control Policy:

<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="assets/service-control-policy.jpg" alt="service-control-policy" width="700"/></p>

- Here we have our root Organizational Unit (OU) and the master account. The root OU allows all services, and there is a DenyAccessAthena SCP on master account. This deny will not work, because the master account is not affected by SCP.
- Inside our root OU we have a PROD OU that explicitly deny redshift access (DenyRedshiftAccess). It will make all accounts inside it to not have access to redshift, even the Account A that tries to access Redshift with a AuthorizeRedshift SCP. But the higher one is a deny and it has precedence in this case.
- HR OU has no access to redshift and has no access to Lambda (due DenyAWSLambda SCP)
- Finance OU has no access only to Deny

[Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_examples.html) of SCP allowing access to all resources but not to DynamoDB in all accounts.

## AWS ControlTower

AWS ControlTower is a easy way to setup and govern a secure and compliant multi-account AWS environment based on best practices.

With ControlTower we can:

- automate the setup of the environment with a few clicks
- automate ongoing policies applying guardrails
  - detect policy violations
- monitor compliance in a dashboard.
- automatically sets up AWS Organizations to organize accounts and implement SCPs (Service Control Policies)
- it creates three shared accounts: Master Account, Log Archive account and Audit account

## AWS Support Plans

AWS Has multiple types of customer support plans, the pricing of each one is variable as the use.

<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="assets/support-plans-pricing.jpg"  alt="support-plans-pricing" width="400"></p>

## Account Best Practices Summary

- Operating with multiple accounts use AWS Organizations
- Restricting power into the account use Service Control Policy
- Setup multiple accounts with best-practices with AWS ControlTower
- Use tags and Cost allocation tags for easy billing/management
- IAM guidelines: MFA, Password policies, Least privilege principle
- Use Config to record all the resources and configurations and do compliance over time
- Use CloudFormation to deploy the stack across the regions
- Use CloudTrail to track all the api calls in our account
- Trusted Advisor is great tool to get insight to get the best cost optimization and the support plan
- Send Services Logs and Access Logs to S3 or CloudWatch Logs (Maybe have an account just to logging)
- If anything compromises the account: change the root password, delete and rotate all passwords and keys, and get in touch to AWS Support.
