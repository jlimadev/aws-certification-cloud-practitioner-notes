### EBS Elastic Block Store - Volumes

**Main Informations about Elastic Block Store**:

- An EBS Volume is a **network drive** that you can attach to your instance while they run. It uses the network to communicate with the instance, so it might have a little bit of latency.
- It can be detached from an instance and attached to other quickly (benefit of network driver)
- It Can persist data even if the instance is terminated.
- Can be mounted to one instance at a time (On CCP level exam). One instance can have more than one EBS at a time.
- They are bound to a specific availability zone, this means if your instance is in us-east1-a and your EBS is in us-east1-b, they cannot be bound to each other. To do it across AZs, we need **Snapshots**.
- It have a provisioned capacity in GBs or IOPs (inputs and outputs per second). The billing is based on this capacity, and this capacity can be increased/decreased over time.

**Good to know about EBS**:

- Free tier: 30 GB of EBS on General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic per Month.
- Analogy to a "network USB stick" that you can plug in other computers.
- We can have existing EBS volumes that keeps unattached.
- EBS Volumes are network drives with good but 'limited' performance: EC2 Instance Store have the best performance, because they are the hard disk, physical, on the data-center attached on the machine that runs the server.
